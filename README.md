# ML-Final-Project


-to find the median market rent, they group the buildings by green/non-green. this ignores how location impacts pricing. it would've been better if they considered location and green/non-green, as the data is already clustered into nearby groups of 12 buildings. 

-Therefore the math that they do based on the calculated median amounts cannot necessarily be trusted

-they didnt discuss other factors that may impact willingness to pay like access to internal amenities and proximity to external amenities

-they also didn't mention the building quality (class a, b, or c) which would play a major factor in willingness to pay

-all of these aspects (and more) make me skeptical of the conclusions.
